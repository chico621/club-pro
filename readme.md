MyDigiClub

Introduction
MyDigiClub is a digital hub built using Expo and Supabase that helps users connect, collaborate, and engage through clubs, events, and community features — all in one place. This project is built on a solid foundation of modern tools including Expo Router for navigation, Supabase for backend and authentication, Tailwind CSS for styling, React Hook Form and Zod for form validation, and TypeScript for type safety and clarity.

Whether you're launching a school club, hobby group, or local community, MyDigiClub empowers your members with a seamless mobile experience.

⚠️ Note: This is a personal project using an opinionated stack. It’s not a framework or boilerplate, but a practical example of how to structure a scalable mobile app using current best practices.
