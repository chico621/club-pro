MyDigiClub

Introduction
MyDigiClub is a digital hub built using Expo and Supabase that helps users connect, collaborate, and engage through clubs, events, and community features â€” all in one place. This project is built on a solid foundation of modern tools including Expo Router for navigation, Supabase for backend and authentication, Tailwind CSS for styling, React Hook Form and Zod for form validation, and TypeScript for type safety and clarity. This application was built using Vincent Flemings Expo + Supabase starter template.

Whether you're launching a school club, hobby group, or local community, MyDigiClub empowers your members with a seamless mobile experience.
